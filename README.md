# Setup instructions for flask webapp.
To set up this webapp we require python and flask installed on the device.

Step 1)We have to create the flask app stucture in the desired directory. This includes a folder called templates that contains 
the .html files, folder called static that includes the stylesheets and a python file.

Step 2)Next we have to create the neccessary .html files or templates used in the app. I have uploaded the templates I made in the templates_folder folder of this repo. We also have to create a .py file. I have uploaded it to this repo. I did not use any stylesheets so the static folder will remain empty.

Step 3)Download the .html and .py files from this repo and put them in the above mentioned structure. 

Step 4)Execute the python file and test the results in the browser at - localhost:(port) with any sample .txt file.
